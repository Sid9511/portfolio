## **Description**
Welcome to my portfolio site, crafted with the power of TypeScript and Next.js. To ensure a modern and engaging user experience, I've utilized Tailwind CSS and AcertinityUI for a sleek and intuitive design. This site serves as a comprehensive showcase of my professional journey and technical expertise.

On this platform, you can explore various sections to learn more about me. The "About" section provides a personal overview, while the "Tech Stack" section highlights my technological skills. The "Experience" section outlines my professional background, and the "Projects" section displays the work Iâ€™ve created using my expertise. For any inquiries or opportunities, the "Contact" section is readily available.

To enhance the site's reliability and user experience, I've integrated Sentry for monitoring, allowing users to raise issues if any bugs are encountered. 

All of this is seamlessly hosted and deployed on the Vercel platform, ensuring optimal performance and accessibility.
